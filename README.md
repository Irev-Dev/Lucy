OpenSCAD/Parametric Miniquad Frame, designed with agressively tilted body and with flat arms for minimal blockage of the thrust columns. The result is a quad that is most aerodynamic when flown at its most agressive angle as opposed to most miniquad frames which become less aerodynamic the further forward they are tilted.

Named after [Lucy Gonzalez Parsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrSSR_JgHME "More Dangerous Than a Thousand Rioters: The Revolutionary Life of Lucy Parsons") 

The frame is intended to be made from carbonfiber with some printed parts. It's currently being prototyped so contributions are welcome.

## Contributing
I thought it was about time I got this code up on github, so I don't have any immediate ideas of ways to contribute. I need to do an initial tidy of the code and then maybe I'll put together a plan of improvements/features that can be done. But by all means contact me with ideas or make a change and make a pull request.

At this stage the frame has not been tested at all, I have quad components arriving soon, I plan on testing it by printing it completely out of PLA (because it's cheap). It will break the first time it's crashed without a doubt, but I think PLA should be rigid and strong enough while in flight. If the frame progresses nicely and I get some carbonfiber cut I'm not sure what filament should be used for the final printed parts. I have some taulman 910 nylon which I think is probably a good mix of tough and rigid, but perhaps PETG or TPU should be used?
