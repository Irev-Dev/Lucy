OpenSCAD/Parametric Miniquad Frame, designed with  agressively tilted body and with flat quad arms for minimal blockage in the thrust columns. The result is a quad that is most aerodynamic when flown at it's most agressive angle as opposed to most miniquad frames which become less aerodynamic the further forward they are tilted.

The frame is intended to be made from carbonfiber with some printed parts. It's currently being prototyped so contributions are welcome.
