OpenSCAD/Parametric Miniquad Frame, designed with agressively tilted body and with flat arms for minimal blockage of the thrust columns. The result is a quad that is most aerodynamic when flown at its most agressive angle as opposed to most miniquad frames which become less aerodynamic the further forward they are tilted.

Named after [Lucy Gonzalez Parsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrSSR_JgHME "More Dangerous Than a Thousand Rioters: The Revolutionary Life of Lucy Parsons") 

The frame is intended to be made from carbonfiber with some printed parts. It's currently being prototyped so contributions are welcome.

## Contributing
I thought it was about time I got this code up on github, so I don't have any immediate ideas of ways to contribute. I need to do an initial tidy of the code and then maybe I'll put together a plan of improvements/features that can be done. But by all means contact me with ideas or make a change and make a pull request.

At this stage the frame has not been tested at all, I have quad components arriving soon, I plan on testing it by printing it completely out of PLA (because it's cheap). It will break the first time it's crashed without a doubt, but I think PLA should be rigid and strong enough while in flight. If the frame progresses nicely and I get some carbonfiber cut I'm not sure what filament should be used for the final printed parts. I have some taulman 910 nylon which I think is probably a good mix of tough and rigid, but perhaps PETG or TPU should be used?

## Features
### Parametric

Most dimensions can be tweaked. The image above for example shows the angle of the body relative to the props varying from 40 to 70 degrees and the distance between the rear props changing from 180 to 130mm.

### Low Drag
This is where I hope this frame will come into it's own. Most quad frams have a elongated body which creates negitive lift while flying and creates more drag the more agressively the quad is flown, while compact frames reduce this somewhat the arms of the quad still block a large amount of the thrust column which is inevitable when the motors are mounted directly to carbon fiber sheet. Lucy Kwad get around this by having a very agressivly tilted body and tilted motor mounts. The body is tilted further than the camera angle so that during medium speed flight there is some drag but also some positive lift and in top speed flight the frame should will be tilt so to have the least drag. The arms of the quad are tilted at the same angle as the body thanks to the tilted motor mounts.
The image below shows the body tilt at a greater angle than the camera. 70 degrees in the images though this is a guess, testing is needed.
